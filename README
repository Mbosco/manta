Welcome to Manta!

Manta is a simple synchronization system that is designed to make local databses easily accessible anywhere.

Manta is composed of three separate projects that work together:
  * Upload, which sends data from a local SQL database up to an accessible server,
  * Store, a JSON-based REST store that suports incremental synchronization, and
  * Sync, an agent which syncronizes the remote data to a local system for offline access.

Multiple Sync implemenations can be provided, depending on the source platform. In particular, though, the project provides:

  * Manta Sync for Android, an Android ContentProvider that transparently provides native access to your remote data.

Manta is designed to be easily reusable for a variety of situations where you need local SQL data made available on remote devices or browsers, without requiring you to re-invent the wheel each time. Manta currently powers Simple MFI, an application for microfinance loan officers, which gives them access to all their client data (usually held in an on-premise MIS database) on a low-cost Android phone.

More information about each Manta component can be found in the README in each directory, and on the main project page, at:
