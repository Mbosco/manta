indexes:

# This index.yaml is automatically updated whenever the dev_appserver
# detects that a new type of query is run.  If you want to manage the
# index.yaml file manually, remove the above marker line (the line
# saying "# AUTOGENERATED").  If you want to manage some indexes
# manually, move them above the marker line.  The index.yaml file is
# automatically uploaded to the admin console when you next deploy
# your application using appcfg.py.

# TODO: Currently these indexes are specific for the Simple MFI
# application. They are harmless for other applications. However, for
# other applications, you should write your own indexes for facet
# properties, or you should turn autogeneration back on.
